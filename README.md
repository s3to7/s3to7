### if you think you're the biggest riko fan think again
- i go by many names, but the most common ones are: j, jiwoo, and zhiyu!
- i have a few disorders i would not like to explicitly disclose... but please be patient with me! i have frequent mood swings and my personality might change a lot!
- i always leave pt on in the bg while i do work and stuff so pls whisper me if i dont respond!!
- my discord is kiranobz; pls tell me who you are or if youre sending a req so ik its you ><
- im a okay with being friends with everyone!!! send me a friend request i will definitely accept!!
- im almost always near spawn :3

### to note
- i usually associate myself with, or like to present myself as certain characters... mostly amanai riko ^^; so calling me riko is also veryveryvery okay too
- i won't write a proper dni because i'm pretty loose with who i let interact with me, but please don't interact if you're a minor! otherwise, just don't be weird and always be respectful! ><
