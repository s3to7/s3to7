### if you think you're the biggest riko fan think again
- call me j, or zhiyu!
- i have a few disorders i would not like to explicitly disclose... but please be patient with me! i have frequent mood swings and my personality might change a lot!
- i always leave pt on in the bg while i do work and stuff so pls whisper me if i dont respond!!
- im a okay with being friends with everyone!!! send me a friend request i will definitely accept!! c+h is also okay, unless you see i'm with someone else already ^^
- shipping is alright, i'm ok with any ship ^^ 

### to note
- i heavily associate myself with/like to present myself as amanai riko. this sounds childish but try not to speak badly about her around me!! i am the only riko ever. if you think you are riko THINK AGAIN!!! OR DNI!!!
- i won't write a proper dni because i'm pretty loose with who i let interact with me, but please don't interact if you're a minor! otherwise, just always be respectful! ><
